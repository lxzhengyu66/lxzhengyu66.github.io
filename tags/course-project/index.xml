      <description>Westward drift of the non-dipole part is nature of great importance of the Geomagnetic field. In the class:Theory of Geoelectricity and Geomagnetism we were asked to visualize this trend. Using spherical harmonic coefficients from IGRF (International Geomagnetic Reference Field) up to 12 degree I was able to plot the z component of non-dipole field from 1900 to 2015 with Matlab and combine them in a GIF, you can see the drift is very obvious.</description>

      <description>In the final project of Principles of artificial intelligence, we managed to establish a neural network using tensorflow , tflearn and sklearn. We wrote our own JS collecting program and then analyzed the wave of motion sensors of smartphones and defined an touching event. Better than previous study deducing only 4-digit PIN, our model can give coordinates of the touching location on the phone screen and successfully recognized a sentence.</description>
