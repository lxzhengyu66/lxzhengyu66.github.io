      <description>Origin of the two LLSVPs inside the lower mantle is heavily debated,from purely thermal to purely compositional. These features are presumably very important for modulating Earthâ€™s long-term evolution such as the main heat source for generating mantle plumes and surface volcanism. We want to place better constraints on these mantle structures through examining their geodynamic properties.
With the finite element code CitcomS, I built a thermal chemical model to explore the response of different viscosity profile (and LVV,lateral viscosity variation) , scaling between tomography and density and chemical buoyancy.</description>
